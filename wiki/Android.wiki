#summary Description of the SM@RT case on Android

= Introduction =

We used SM@RT to provide runtime model support for Android platform. For this initial version, we represent some very simple Android runtime data (including the WiFi and process status) as a dynamic Ecore model, which conforms to the meta-model as shown below.

To show how to use such a runtime model, we ship it with an OCL interpreter, so that you can write OCL queries to indicate and aggregate the runtime data.

Below, we first show how to use the final APK on your android phone, so that you can have a intuitive vision about what is a runtime model for android. After that, we show a bit about how to provide such a runtime model support using SM@RT.

= Get stated with the APK =

First, download our final all-in-one APK file from [http://smatrt.googlecode.com/files/ocladapt.apk here], and install it on a mobile phone with Android 1.5+. Run the application, and you will see the only Activity, as shown below. In the text box, you can input an OCL query conforming to the meta-model shown above, and after clicking the only button, you'll see the query result. Try executing the same query several times, you'll finally see that the result is changing according to system or environment changes. If you are not familiar with OCL, try to long-click the text box to switch among several built-in OCL queries (please, forgive our poor UI design right now, because anytime you long-click the box, you have to first close the input selection dialog). Here are some screen caught from my own android phone. We have tested this apk on HTC Hero and Moto Droid.
