#summary A case study between C2 and JOnAS

===Introduction===

[http://wiki.jonas.objectweb.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome JOnAS] is an open source JEE application server developed by [http://www.objectweb.org/ ObjectWeb].  We specified and generated an adapter to support users in managing JOnAS systems (like [http://java.sun.com/developer/releases/petstore/ Java Pet Store] deployed on JOnAS). We put the specification, the generated adapters, the utility tools , and the test data [http://code.google.com/p/sandtablist/source/browse/#svn/trunk/casestudy/c2_jonas here].

===Dependence===

The generation tool and the generated synchronizer have to run upon [http://www.eclipse.org/ Eclipse 3.4] or later with [http://www.eclipse.org/projects/project_summary.php?projectid=modeling EMF] support. To test the generated synchronizer, you still have to install a JOnAS server (we have only tested [http://forge.objectweb.org/project/showfiles.php?group_id=5 version 4.9.2]), and copy the "client.jar" and "mejb.jar" of your JOnAS into the generated system adapter.

===Specification===

The specifications we wrote are stored in the "specification" directory, where  "JOnAS.ecore" is the system meta-model, "JOnAS.decorate" is the access model, 

===Generation===

The "specification" direction stores the generated adapter.

===Use===
In the usage directory, we defined the C2 meta-model and a QVT to relate this architecture style with the JOnAS system, and use them to generate a synchronizer that dynamically relate the architecture models with the running JOnAS system. Adminstrators could use the the architecture model to monitor and control the system.

The "utility" direction stores a graphical C2 editor, and the "test" directory stores two EJBs implementating the "Product and Item Artists" components, and a web module implementing the RSS generator.

Here are the snapshots for using this generator.

First, the C2 editor and the interface of Java Pet Store.

Then, we add the "Artists" and the RSS generator, and currently the RSS generator connects to the "Item Artist", and we can get an RSS seed about all items

At last, we link the RSS generator with the "Product Artist"
