#summary The JarUML case

This case is a reproduction of the [http://ssel.vub.ac.be/ssel/research:mdd:jar2uml Jar2UML] tool developed by [http://ssel.vub.ac.be/ssel/about:members:denniswagelaar Dennis Wagelaar]. We use a simplified UML meta-model as the system meta-model, and write an access model to wrap the invocation of [http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel/ BCEL] tool. All the specification could be found [http://code.google.com/p/smatrt/source/browse/#svn/trunk/cases/JarUML/specification here]. The generated adapter could reflect the structure of Java classes inside a Jar file. 

We utilize the visualization support provided by Eclipse [http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/mdt/?project=uml2 UML2] tools to generated and show the class diagram of the reflected UML model. Here is snapshot of the generated class diagram for java.io.*

Note that this is a "reduced version" of runtime management, because the jar file do not change during runtime.
